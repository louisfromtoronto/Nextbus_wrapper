# Nextbus_wrapper
This project is a JavaScript wrapper for the NextBus Public XML feed. You
can read more about the NextBus Public XML Feed [here](https://www.nextbus.com/xmlFeedDocs/NextBusXMLFeed.pdf).

This wrapper will allow users to make calls to the XML feed, and will return
representations of the NextBus data in JavaScript-friendly formats, such as JSON,
arrays or dictionaries. This wrapper will completely handle making the appropriate
HTTP GET requests.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository to your system. Open the repository directory in Terminal,
and run the command ```npm update```. This will install the node packages 
necessary for the wrapper to work. 

To use the wrapper, import ```index.js``` into your project.
